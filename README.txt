Smoking vs GDP vs Environment

Lung cancer, heart attack, anxiety, and stroke. Those are the most well-known effects of cigarettes on smokerâ€™s health that constantly torture them every day of their old age. Around 1.3 billion people worldwide and 35 million Americans are smokers, and approximately 20% of those are heavily addicted and half of them suffer from respiratory disease. Cigarettes, though being a new invention of mankind, are slowly but inevitably killing many dependent souls. 


However, besides the indisputable health degradation, smoking indeed can result in many hidden consequences. For some growing tobacco-dependent nations, such as Zimbabwe, Brazil, or Zambia, this industry acts as a major source of income and occupation for a lot of farmers, which not only might lead to a higher GDP through exporting but also can have essential impacts on their environment.


This project contains brief visualizations of how cigarettes actually affect these two fields and concludes several consequences around the subject of producing tobacco.
